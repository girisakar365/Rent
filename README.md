### RENT:
The main purpose of this program is to calculate the total amount of rent to be paid by the tenant (The person(s) or party who lives in a rent house) every month and keep it as data.

### Starting Up:
After entering the main program, we will see the record section where we can record the amount to be paid in each category.

##### Category contains:
        1. Electricity (Present and Previous meter)
        2. Water (Unit according to Water supply authority which is usually 11 unit or 12 unit, present and previous meter)
        3. Waste
        4. Rent

After recording a rent user will be guided to search section where user can automatically see the record that they have just made. Users can also search the records according to the month and year of the record that they have selected in the record section.
User will also be able to delete or edit the record in case of error or any due cause. We would also like to mention that this time we introduce to you the new QR-Code feature whose detail will be given in the List of updates.
We have also provided a setting section where user will be able to customize the UI.
We have provided customization options such as:
1. Security. 
2. User's name.
3. Background customization.

## New Updates:
Major changes have been made to this program! The GUI of this program is way too easy to use. Every single thing in this program is designed to construct a user-friendly environment. This time user will not find a major-issues in running the program as almost all the bugs of the program has been fixed. Thus, user will be entertained with every single feature included in this program.

#### List of updates:
1.	This time users should not use any kind of default password set by the developer in order to enter the main program. It means we are providing users an option to either enable or disable security.
Similarly, the security section also contains a minor update which we call the ___password generator___. Password generator is a feature which generates a unique and secured password every time we use it. Using this feature will make the data more secured.

2.	User will now be able to use the QR-Code feature. This feature is one of the biggest changes in this version. User can scan the QR code in order to get the information of the record in their other devices. This feature will be useful to send the details of the rental payment to the tenant.

3.	We also have provided a feature to reset all the settings made by the user.

4. User will now be able to export their data to an excel file in excel in .csv file format. This will allow user to save their data and analyze it with the help of excel.

### Attention:
This time we have made a linked based file system to run this application which means that their will be a lot of dependency files inorder to run the program. This program is not completely costumizable thus, changing the file system may lead to difficulties in running the program.
 
__So, we would strongly recommend you not to change or delete or mislead any files inculded in the main file system.__

### Conclusion:
Coming to this version we would like to mention that the frequency of bugs or error in this program are negligible. Thus, after working almost 2 and a half months in this project we are closing this project with this version. However, some minor updates may be made to this program sometime in the future.

Hope you will appreciate the work. Good Luck!
